Spring Boot Actuator is a set of features in Spring Boot that provides endpoints for monitoring and managing your application.

####Some of the key features of Spring Boot Actuator include:

Health Endpoint: This endpoint returns information about the health of your application, including details about any problems that might be affecting it.

Metrics Endpoint: This endpoint provides detailed metrics about your application, including information about memory usage, CPU usage, and more.

Info Endpoint: This endpoint returns information about your application, such as its version, build number, and other relevant details.

Environment Endpoint: This endpoint provides information about the environment in which your application is running, 

including information about the JVM, system properties, and more.

Beans Endpoint: This endpoint returns information about the beans that have been defined in your application's context.

Mappings Endpoint: This endpoint provides information about the mappings between URLs and the controllers that handle them.

Trace Endpoint: This endpoint provides information about the request and response history for your application.

All of these features can be accessed through a set of RESTful endpoints that are automatically exposed by Spring Boot Actuator 

when you include it as a dependency in your application. These endpoints can be secured and customized to meet your specific needs.



```

import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.Endpoint;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.ReadOperation;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.WriteOperation;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Endpoint(id="custom")
public class CustomEndpoint {

  private String message = "Hello World";

  @ReadOperation
  public String getMessage() {
    return message;
  }

  @WriteOperation
  public void setMessage(String message) {
    this.message = message;
  }
}


```


This code creates a custom endpoint in your Spring Boot application that can be used to get and set a message. 

The @ReadOperation and @WriteOperation annotations indicate that this endpoint can be used for read and write operations, respectively.

The /actuator/custom endpoint can be used to access this functionality. 

To retrieve the message, you can use a GET request, and to set the message, you can use a POST request with the desired message in the request body.

This is just one example of what you can do with Spring Boot Actuator. 

The Actuator provides a variety of other endpoints that allow you to monitor and manage your application, 

such as /actuator/health to check the health of your application, 

and /actuator/info to retrieve information about your application.
