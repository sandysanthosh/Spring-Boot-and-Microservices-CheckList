Hystrix is a library for providing fault tolerance in a microservices architecture. 

It allows you to add a layer of protection against failures in your system by providing fallbacks or default behavior when a service fails. 

In a Spring Boot application, you can integrate Hystrix by using the spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix dependency.

Here is an example of how to use Hystrix in a Spring Boot REST API:


```


import com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.annotation.HystrixCommand;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {
        return employeeService.getAllEmployees();
    }

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "getEmployeeByIdFallback")
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Employee getEmployeeById(@PathVariable(value = "id") Long employeeId) {
        return employeeService.getEmployeeById(employeeId);
    }

    public Employee getEmployeeByIdFallback(Long employeeId) {
        return new Employee();
    }
}


```

Here, the **@HystrixCommand** annotation is used to annotate the **getEmployeeById** method. 

If the method fails, the fallback method **getEmployeeByIdFallback** will be called instead. 

In this example, the fallback method simply returns a default Employee object. 

You can customize the fallback behavior to meet the needs of your application.

In addition to fallback methods, Hystrix also provides features for circuit breaker, thread pool isolation, 

and more to help you build resilient and fault-tolerant systems.
