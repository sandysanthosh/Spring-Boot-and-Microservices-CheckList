To expose JPA repositories as REST endpoints in a Spring Boot application, you can use the spring-boot-starter-data-rest library,

which provides support for building RESTful services based on Spring Data repositories.

Here's an example of how to create a REST repository for a JPA entity using Spring Boot:

#### First, add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>

```


#### Next, create a JPA entity that represents the data you want to expose as a REST endpoint. For example:

```
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String email;
    // ... other fields and getters/setters
}


```

#### Create a JPA repository for the entity. For example:


```
@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "employees", path = "employees")
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
}


```

That's it! The EmployeeRepository is now automatically exposed as a REST endpoint at the /employees path. 

You can perform CRUD operations on the entity using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).


**Note** that you can further customize the REST endpoint by annotating the repository methods or the entity class with Spring Data REST annotations. 

For example, you can use the @RestResource annotation to specify a different name for the endpoint, or use the @RepositoryRestResource annotation 

to customize the path, collection resource name, and other aspects of the endpoint.
