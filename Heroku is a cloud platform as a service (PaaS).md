Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that can be used to deploy and run web applications. 

Here are the steps to deploy a Spring Boot REST API on Heroku:

Create a new application in Heroku and give it a name.

Connect your Git repository to the Heroku application by following the instructions in the Heroku Dashboard.

Create a pom.xml file with the following dependencies:

```

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>


```

Create a Procfile file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```
web: java -jar target/{your-app-name}.jar
```

Push your code to the Git repository. Heroku will automatically detect the code and build it using the Maven build process.

Open the Heroku Dashboard, select your application, and click the "Open App" button to access the deployed Spring Boot REST API.

Note: Before deploying your application, make sure it runs locally without any errors. You can also test your application on Heroku by using the Heroku CLI.
