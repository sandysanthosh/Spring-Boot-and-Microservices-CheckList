To test a Spring Boot API using Axios in the front-end, you can make HTTP requests using the Axios library. 
  
  
  Here's an example using a GET request to retrieve data from a Spring Boot API:
  
  
  
  ```
  import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/api';

axios.get(`${API_URL}/data`)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });


```


In this example, API_URL is the URL of your Spring Boot API, and the axios.get method is used to make a GET request to retrieve data from the /data endpoint. The response data is logged to the console if the request is successful, or an error is logged if the request fails.

Note: In this example, it's assumed that the API is running on localhost on port 8080. You'll need to update the URL to match the actual location of your API.
