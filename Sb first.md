When starting a new Spring Boot project, consider adding the following components:

1. **Dependencies:** Choose dependencies based on your project requirements. Common ones include `Spring Web` for RESTful web services, `Spring Data JPA` for data access, and `Thymeleaf` or `Freemarker` for templating.

2. **Database Configuration:** Configure your database connection in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Use `spring.datasource.*` properties for database settings.

3. **Entity Classes:** Create JPA entity classes to model your data and interact with the database.

4. **Repository Interfaces:** Define interfaces extending `JpaRepository` or similar for CRUD operations on your entities.

5. **Service Classes:** Implement business logic in service classes that use repository interfaces. 

6. **Controller Classes:** Create controllers to handle HTTP requests and interact with service classes. Use annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.

7. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Consider using DTOs to encapsulate data sent between the client and server, avoiding exposing internal entity structures.

8. **Exception Handling:** Implement global exception handling to handle errors uniformly across your application.

9. **Security Configuration:** If needed, configure security for your application using Spring Security.

10. **Logging:** Add logging using a framework like SLF4J and Logback or Log4j to track application behavior.

11. **Testing:** Write unit tests for your components using tools like JUnit and Mockito. Consider adding integration tests as well.

12. **Documentation:** Document your code using comments, and consider adding API documentation using tools like Swagger.

13. **Build Tool Configuration:** Set up your project with a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Define dependencies, plugins, and build profiles as needed.

14. **Environment Configuration:** Utilize profiles for different environments (development, production, etc.) and externalize configuration using property files.

15. **Logging:** Set up appropriate logging configurations for debugging and monitoring purposes.

16. **Dependency Injection:** Leverage Spring's dependency injection to manage and wire your components.

17. **Version Control:** Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git) and commit your initial project structure.

Remember to adapt these steps based on the specific requirements and architecture of your project.
