Spring Boot DevTools is a set of tools that can be included in your application to improve the development experience. 

One of the key features of DevTools is the ability to automatically reload the application when files change. 

This can save time and increase productivity by eliminating the need to manually restart the application after every change.

To use DevTools in a Spring Boot application, you will need to add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Once you have included the DevTools dependency, you can start your application in development mode with the spring-boot-devtools module on the classpath. 

For example, if you are using the Maven Spring Boot plugin, you can start your application with the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run

```

With DevTools enabled, any changes you make to the application code or configuration files will trigger a reload of the application. 

You can also use the "Restart" button in your IDE to manually trigger a reload, which can be useful if DevTools is unable to detect a change automatically.

Note that DevTools is only intended for use during development, and should not be included in a production deployment of your application.
