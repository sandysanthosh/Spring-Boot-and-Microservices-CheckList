# ANSWER:

### 1. Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of creating and deploying production-ready applications quickly. It embodies several fundamental principles that make it advantageous compared to the traditional Spring framework:

1. **Opinionated Defaults**: Spring Boot provides default configurations and sensible project structures, reducing the need for developers to configure settings manually. It follows the convention over configuration principle, allowing rapid development by minimizing boilerplate code.

2. **Auto-configuration**: It leverages the concept of auto-configuration, where based on the classpath and dependencies present, Spring Boot automatically configures various components. Developers can override these defaults by providing their own configurations.

3. **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot includes embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that can be deployed along with the application. This eliminates the need for manual server setup and configuration, simplifying deployment.

4. **Standalone**: Spring Boot applications can be run standalone, meaning they can be executed as a JAR file without requiring deployment into a separate application server. This simplifies deployment and makes the application more portable.

5. **Microservices Support**: Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices architecture. It provides features like Spring Cloud, which offers tools for building distributed systems and includes components for service discovery, configuration management, and more.

6. **Reduced Development Time**: By providing a set of defaults, embedded servers, and easy-to-use configurations, Spring Boot significantly reduces the time required for setting up and starting a new project. Developers can focus more on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

7. **Extensive Ecosystem**: Spring Boot integrates seamlessly with the larger Spring ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage various Spring projects and libraries easily. It supports integration with databases, security, messaging systems, and more.

8. **Actuators and Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in endpoints to monitor and manage applications easily. It offers metrics, health checks, and other useful information about the application, facilitating better monitoring and troubleshooting.



### 2. **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling between classes and their dependencies. In DI, rather than a class creating its dependencies directly, the dependencies are provided ("injected") into the class from an external source. This approach makes classes more reusable, testable, and easier to maintain, as it promotes flexibility and allows easier swapping of dependencies.

In the Spring framework, dependency injection is achieved mainly through **Inversion of Control (IoC)**. IoC is the principle where the control over object creation and management is inverted from the application code to a container or framework. The Spring IoC container manages the creation and lifecycle of objects (beans) and injects dependencies into the classes.

Spring supports two main types of dependency injection:

1. **Constructor Injection**:
   - In constructor injection, dependencies are injected through a class constructor.
   - Spring container identifies the dependencies required by a class and injects them through the constructor at the time of bean creation.
   - Example:
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       private final MyDependency dependency;

       public MyClass(MyDependency dependency) {
           this.dependency = dependency;
       }

       // Other class methods
   }
   ```
   - Configuration in Spring:
   ```xml
   <beans>
       <bean id="dependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
       <bean id="myClassBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
           <constructor-arg ref="dependencyBean" />
       </bean>
   </beans>
   ```

2. **Setter Injection**:
   - In setter injection, dependencies are injected using setter methods.
   - Spring container uses JavaBean-style setter methods to inject dependencies into the class after the bean is instantiated.
   - Example:
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       private MyDependency dependency;

       public void setDependency(MyDependency dependency) {
           this.dependency = dependency;
       }

       // Other class methods
   }
   ```
   - Configuration in Spring:
   ```xml
   <beans>
       <bean id="dependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
       <bean id="myClassBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
           <property name="dependency" ref="dependencyBean" />
       </bean>
   </beans>
   ```

Spring also supports **Field Injection** where dependencies are injected directly into class fields. However, this approach is generally discouraged due to reduced testability and issues with encapsulation.

To summarize, Spring supports Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Field Injection as methods for achieving dependency injection, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate method based on their application design and requirements.

### Creating RESTful APIs with Spring Boot involves defining endpoints that respond to HTTP requests. Spring Boot simplifies this process by providing annotations from the `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation` package to handle various HTTP methods and map them to corresponding controller methods.

Here are the commonly used annotations in Spring Boot for handling HTTP requests:

1. **@RestController**:
   - This annotation is used at the class level to define a controller that handles incoming HTTP requests and returns the response directly in the format requested (JSON, XML, etc.).
   - Example:
   ```java
   @RestController
   public class MyRestController {
       // Controller methods
   }
   ```

2. **@RequestMapping**:
   - This annotation is used at the method level to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods.
   - It allows you to specify the URL path and HTTP method for which the method will handle the request.
   - Example:
   ```java
   @RestController
   public class MyRestController {
       @RequestMapping(value = "/api/resource", method = RequestMethod.GET)
       public ResponseEntity<String> getResource() {
           // Method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

3. **@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping**:
   - These annotations are shortcuts for mapping specific HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, respectively.
   - They are more concise alternatives to @RequestMapping for specific HTTP methods.
   - Example:
   ```java
   @RestController
   public class MyRestController {
       @GetMapping("/api/resource")
       public ResponseEntity<String> getResource() {
           // GET method implementation
       }

       @PostMapping("/api/resource")
       public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Resource resource) {
           // POST method implementation
       }

       @PutMapping("/api/resource/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<String> updateResource(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Resource resource) {
           // PUT method implementation
       }

       @DeleteMapping("/api/resource/{id}")
       public ResponseEntity<String> deleteResource(@PathVariable Long id) {
           // DELETE method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

4. **@PathVariable**:
   - This annotation is used to extract values from the URI path and map them to method parameters.
   - It is commonly used to capture dynamic parts of the URL.
   - Example:
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/api/resource/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<String> getResourceById(@PathVariable Long id) {
       // Method implementation using the 'id' path variable
   }
   ```

5. **@RequestBody**:
   - This annotation is used to bind the HTTP request body to a method parameter.
   - It is commonly used to handle incoming data in POST or PUT requests.
   - Example:
   ```java
   @PostMapping("/api/resource")
   public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody Resource resource) {
       // Method implementation using the 'resource' from the request body
   }
   ```

These annotations, combined with proper method implementations, help in creating well-defined RESTful APIs using Spring Boot by mapping HTTP requests to appropriate controller methods and handling the request and response data effectively.
